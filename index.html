        <h3 style="padding:30px;">Lionel Messi was born Luis Lionel Andres Messi on June 24, 1987, in Rosario,
            Argentina. As a young boy, he tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends,
            unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old
            Boys, a Rosario-based club. Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was
            eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth.

        <h3 style="padding:30px;">Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone
            deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical
            treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged
            17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an
            integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon
            d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted
            campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish
            football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record
